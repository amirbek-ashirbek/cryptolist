# cryptolist
An app which displays a list of cryptocurrency coins and shows more details when clicked on a specific coin using data from Coinpaprika API. The app is written in 100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Includes several features, such as swipe-refresh logic and a Splash Screen, which dismisses when the coins data is loaded. Developing this project made me better understand the practicality of CA, as I realized that this app was not complex enough to implement CA
